                <div class="f_right">
                    I'm a software developer with a diverse set of skills ranging from full-stack development, UI/UX design, and content writing.
                    I focus on creating user-friendly web applications that are simple, clean, and visually appealing.
                    Many of my projects are internal applications that are not publicly available.
                    Feel free to call up my previous companies for their code-base to view my work. I'm sure they'll be happy to say no.
                    <br/><br/>
                    You can find me enjoying my life through 3D printing, blogging, crafting, and eating when I'm not coding.
                    As in, I have a life outside of coding.
